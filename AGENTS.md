# figma-make-app

React + Vite + Tailwind CSS project running inside Figma Make.

## Development Server

A Vite development server is **already running** on `$PORT` (default 8443). You don't need to start it manually.

- Preview URL: The user can access the running app through the preview panel
- Hot reload: Changes to source files are reflected immediately

## Project Structure

This is the canonical project structure. Start with task-relevant files below. Only follow imports or inspect other files when required, when a documented path is missing, or when the repository contradicts this guide.

- `public/prototypes/finda-app/` - The team's app (plain HTML/CSS/JS, no build step) and the usual starting point for UI work
- `public/prototypes/finda-app/app.js` - App entrypoint; renders screens into `#app` and wires the preview panel
- `public/prototypes/finda-app/flow.mjs` - Screen flow state (onboarding, home, AI rate); tested by `flow.test.mjs` via `npm test` in that folder
- `index.html` - Root page that immediately redirects to `prototypes/finda-app/index.html`
- `package.json` - Project dependencies and the Vite build, development, preview, and formatting scripts
- `vite.config.ts` - Vite configuration with React, Tailwind CSS v4, and Figma Make plugins plus the `@` alias for `src`
- `.mise.toml` - Toolchain versions for Node.js and pnpm

## Dependencies

- Runtime: React 19 and React DOM 19
- Styling: Tailwind CSS v4 with the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin
- Build tooling: Vite 8, TypeScript 5.7, and `@vitejs/plugin-react`
- Formatting: oxfmt

## Styling

This project uses **Tailwind CSS v4** through the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin configured in `vite.config.ts`. `src/index.css` imports Tailwind with `@import 'tailwindcss';`. Use Tailwind utility classes directly in JSX and put global CSS or Tailwind v4 theme customization in `src/index.css`. This scaffold does not need a Tailwind config file or PostCSS config.

`src/main.tsx` imports `src/index.css`, so global font wiring belongs in `src/index.css`. Keep CSS `@import` statements first, then add any `@font-face` rules and font-family defaults there.

## Code quality

- Use double quotes for strings containing apostrophes (`"We're here to help"`), or escape them in single-quoted strings. An unescaped apostrophe in a single-quoted string breaks the build.
- Ensure JSX tags are closed and braces are balanced.
- Export components as default exports.
